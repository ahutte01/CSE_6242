1) Random forests are better than decision trees because
each tree is a different sample and reduces the error.
Each different tree starts from a different split on
a sample of data, allowing more possibilities, as if
we had a bigger data set, and better boundaries.

2) Run time is around 110 seconds

3) Accuracy is around 71.42%
